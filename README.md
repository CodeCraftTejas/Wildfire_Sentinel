# Wildfire_Sentinel 🔥🌲
A deep learning-based system for detecting forest fires using a custom CNN and generating smart summaries and captions using BART and BLIP.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Detection**: Custom CNN detects forest fires in satellite images
- **Summarization**: BART generates textual summaries
- **Captioning**: BLIP generates image-based captions

## 📁 Files
- `wildfire_detection_summarizer.ipynb`: Full Colab notebook with code, output, and visualizations

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the notebook:
1. Open in Google Colab
2. Upload required image dataset (or use sample)
3. Run all cells

## 📦 Models Used
- CNN (Custom)
- BART (Huggingface Transformers)
- BLIP (Salesforce BLIP)

## 📊 Results
Includes detection visualizations, auto-generated captions, and summaries.
